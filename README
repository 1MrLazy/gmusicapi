A Python API for Google Music.

This is very much a work in progress. It currently supports:
     authentication
     searching for songs
     creating playlists
     adding songs to playlists
     loading the entire library

Check protocol-info for more detailed specifications.


There are two classes in gm_interface.py: GM_API and GM_Communicator.
GM_API is probably what you want to use; it has convenient abstractions of the implemented API calls.
GM_Communicator handles the plumbing for the API. You shouldn't need to use this if everything is working.
