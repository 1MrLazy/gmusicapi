A Python API for Google Music.

This is very much a work in progress. It currently supports:
     authentication
     loading the entire library
     searching for songs
     creating/deleting/adding songs to playlists


Check protocol-info for more detailed specifications.


There are three classes in gm_interface.py: 
      Api: probably what you want to use; it has abstractions of the api calls.
      Tools: some functions for manipulating GM data.
      Communicator: handles the api plumbing. No need to use it if the api is working.
