A Python API for Google Music.

This is a work in progress. Currently it emulates the GM web client; music manager support (with song uploading) is on the way.


Current features:
     authentication

     loading:
	all song metadata
	all user playlists (not auto)

     searching:
	songs
	artists
	albums

     playlist:
	creation
	name changing
	song addition (not removal, yet)
	deletion

     song:
	downloading - gets a link and download count (GM allows 2 downloads per file)
	removal from library
     

See example.py for a usage example.

The docstrings on gmapi.api are descriptive enough for documentation right now.
