A Python API for Google Music.

This is very much a work in progress. It currently supports:
     authentication
     loading the entire library
     searching for songs
     creating/deleting/editing/adding songs to playlists


Check protocol-info for more detailed specifications.


There are two classes in gm_interface:
      Api: what you want to use; it has abstractions of the api calls.
      Communicator: handles the api plumbing. No need to use it if the api is working.

gm_tools provides some utilities to manipulate GM data, and provides the backbone for my playlist importer (https://github.com/simon-weber/Google-Music-Playlist-Importer).
